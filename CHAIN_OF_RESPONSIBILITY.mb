Chain of responsibility is a chain of objects which all could process query or command

- MethodChain - default implementation of this pattern
	It's basically a linked list of commands, which all changes initial object
	(this is actually a problem, cause some properties could be private or so)
	(another problem is inability to delete some of the changes, they are permanent)
