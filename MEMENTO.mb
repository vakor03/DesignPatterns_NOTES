Memento is simply a token or handle class which represents particular state of an object
You can use it to roll back states arbitrarily

- Memento - usually mementos are tokens or objects which represent state
  (Usually they dont have any methods, only readonly properties)

- Undo-Redo - we could save all mementos and then restore to particular point in time
  (With this approach we could create memnto of constructor etc.)
