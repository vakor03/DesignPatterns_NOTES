Composite pattern perform that single object and group of objects could have the same API

There are several approach to do it:
- use IEnumerable of base class - this gives an opportunity to create as single object,
	as group of objects.
	(for single object we yield return this)

- create a nested Lazy collection inside of basic class - this disable collection
	features if we don't need them
